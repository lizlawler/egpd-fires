Exception: Exception: Error in function boost::math::ibeta_derivative<double>(double,double,double): numeric overflow (in '../../../../../../../../gpfs/alpine1/scratch/eslawler@colostate.edu/egpd-fires/full-model/fire-sims/burns/g4/stan/g4_nu-ri_xi-ri.stan', line 25, column 4 to line 26, column 97) (in '../../../../../../../../gpfs/alpine1/scratch/eslawler@colostate.edu/egpd-fires/full-model/fire-sims/burns/g4/stan/g4_nu-ri_xi-ri.stan', line 192, column 4 to column 81)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
