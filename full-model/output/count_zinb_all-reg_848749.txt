Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 1 Exception: neg_binomial_2_log_lpmf: Precision parameter is 0, but must be positive finite! (in '/tmp/RtmpdOqrEy/model-36b13f23cd5f1.stan', line 130, column 8 to line 132, column 100)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
